# Logistics-Insights-Dashboard---Power-BI
Transforming logistics through data : Power BI storytelling dashboard
Excited to share the culmination of a comprehensive data analytics project where I built an interactive Logistics Dashboard in Power BIâ€”designed to uncover actionable insights and optimize supply chain performance.

This dashboard was built with a strong focus on storytelling, helping stakeholders understand critical logistics metrics at a glance. Here's what it covers:

ðŸ”¹ Shipment Performance Overview â€“ Track total shipments, on-time vs. delayed deliveries, and trends across time.
ðŸ”¹ Route Intelligence â€“ Identify the most common shipment routes and those with the longest delivery times.
ðŸ”¹ Delay Analysis â€“ Pinpoint severe, slight, and moderate delays by route, material type, and destination.
ðŸ”¹ Supplier & Customer Insights â€“ Analyze which suppliers handle the most shipments and which customers receive the most, including patterns in delivery reliability.
ðŸ”¹ Material-wise Metrics â€“ View frequently shipped materials and their average delivery performance.
ðŸ”¹ Interactive Map Visuals â€“ Visualize GPS-based delay hotspots across India, giving a geospatial perspective to operational challenges.
